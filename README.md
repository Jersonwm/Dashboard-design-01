# Responsive Dashboard Design #01
I'm going to show you how to use modern HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a completely responsive dashboard with mobile menu functionality. We'll be using CSS Grid, CSS Flexbox, Media queries for our responsive design, and CSS  transitions for some cool animation effects. This dashboard design is responsive in all devices!
